<h1>Kalypso Character Homepage</h1>
<p>Welcome to Siena Kitch & Paul MacLean's website regarding the character traits of Kalypso, the nymph that traps Odysseus on her island for many years in the Odyssey. Use the bar on the left to read more about each trait we have given to Kalypso.</p>
<p>In addition, we have reached the concensus that Kalypso falls under the Meyers Briggs category of ESTJ, standing for Extrovert, Sensing, Thinking, Judging, to quote their website, people in this category have the following qualities: "Active organizer.  Logical. Assertive. Fact minded.  Decisive.  Practical. Results oriented. Analytical. Systematic. Concrete. Critical. Responsible. Take charge. Common sense."</p>
