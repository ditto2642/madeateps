<h1>Trait 1: Controlling</h1>
<br>
<p>Throughout the parts of the Odyssey where she is present, Kalypso is shown to be controlling over Osysseus.<br><br>
“If you could see it all, before you go- all the adversity you face at sea- you would stay here, and guard this house, and be immortal. . . Can I be less desirable than she is? Less interesting? Less beautiful?” (87) After the seven years that Odysseus has stayed with Kalypso, she is reluctant to accept the idea he will move on. She has enjoyed the sweet moments of intimacy where she has been able to control Odysseus, knowing he cannot leave her. When Odysseus reminds her that he does indeed have a wife, Kalypso loses it as she has always been in control.</p>
