<h1>Trait 5: Feminist</h1>
<br>

<p>“You hate it when we choose to lie with men- immortal flesh by some dear mortal side. . . I fed him, loved him, san that he should not die nor grow old, ever, in all the days to come” (84-85). This is a stand out moment for Kalypso as she is showing a new side of her personality. She believes that the sexism occurring during this time period is hard to understand as it is acceptable for male gods to do thing female gods cannot. Within The Odyssey, this is one of the most significant moment for women’s rights and bringing attention to the injustice.
