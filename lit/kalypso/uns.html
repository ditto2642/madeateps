<h1>Trait 4: Unsatisfactory</h1>

<p>“Though he fought shy of her and her desire, he lay with her each night, for she compelled him. But when day came he sat on the rocky shore and broke his own heart groaning, with eyes wet” (85). While Kalypso believes her love to fulfill all of Odysseus’ dreams, this is not the case. Odysseus fights “her and her desire” as he is forced to sleep with Kalypso while longing to leave and escape. Kalypso is obliviant to the idea that Odysseus truly doesn’t enjoy his time with her.</p>
