<h1>Trait 3: Considerate</h1>
<br>
<p>Although she has her negative traits, Kalypso is shown tp be able to be considerate.<br><br>
“Stores I shall put aboard for you- bread, water, and ruby-colored wine, to stay your hunger- give you a seacloack and a following wind to help you homeward without harm- provided the gods who rule wide heaven wish it so” (86). Towards the end of her time with Odysseus, readers see a softer, more passionate side of Kalypso. She is able to show her true love and enjoyment of Odysseus as she helps him prepare for his journey home. She offers him “bread, water, and ruby-colored wine”.</p>
