<h1>Trait 2: Self Centered</h1>
<br>
<p>“Fairness is all I think of. There are hearts made of cold iron- but my heart is kind” (86). Within this time period, Kalypso has been reflecting upon her time with Odysseus; she reminds readers that it was she herself who saved Odysseus from the raging sea as his ship was sank. Unlike other gods, such as Poseidon, she believes that her “heart is kind” and is seen through her care of Odysseus.</p>
